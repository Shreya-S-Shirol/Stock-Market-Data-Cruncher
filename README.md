# Stock-Market-Data-Cruncher
The stock market generates a mountain of data every day, and analyzing it on a normal computer can be painfully slow. Our tool, Stock Market Data Cruncher, fixes this by harnessing the power of parallel computing with OpenMP.
# ðŸ§® Stock Market Data Cruncher (OpenMP)

A high-performance C++ tool for **parallel stock data analysis** using OpenMP.

It computes common trading indicators â€” **SMA**, **RSI**, and **MACD** â€” across massive datasets in parallel, dramatically speeding up computation.
